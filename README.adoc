Re-frame supplementary library to easily declare services and dispatch co-effects/effects requests to service functions

== TL;DR

Re-service allows re-frame user to easily define services. A service here is a named set of functions which provide co-effects
and execute effects required or issued by re-frame event handlers. What re-service does is it translates re-frame co-effects/effects
descriptors into service function calls return values.
